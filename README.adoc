# identikit

An identd (_ident_ aka _auth_ protocol server) coded on a lark (or as
I believe the cool kids would say nowadays, _I did it for the lulz_).
I realized that an identd could be written entirely using Bernstein
chaining and couldn't resist. Going even further, all state is passed
via environment variables!

identikit comes as a self-assembly kit of tiny programs:

* ident-usermap -- Peruse `/etc/passwd` and user home directories
  (they can contain `~/.noident` and `~/.fakeid` files). Set
  IDENT_USERMAP to a userid->identstring mapping based on the results.

* ident-portmap -- Peruse the operating system's list of active TCP
  connections. Look for connections to the host that the socket on
  stdin is coming from. Set IDENT_PORTMAP to a map of port,port,userid
  tuples on that host.

* ident-read -- Read an ident protocol query from stdin. Set
  IDENT_SERVERPORT, IDENT_CLIENTPORT to the port numbers in the query.

* ident-unmap -- Find IDENT_USER (userid) by looking up
  IDENT_SERVERPORT, IDENT_CLIENTPORT in IDENT_PORTMAP (if set). Then
  convert IDENT_USER from userid to identstring by looking it up in
  IDENT_USERMAP (if set). Set IDENT_ERROR if user not found or
  identstring is blank.

* ident-write -- Write ident protocol response to stdout based on
  IDENT_SERVERPORT, IDENT_CLIENTPORT, IDENT_USER, IDENT_ERROR.

Combine them freely (in that order) to build your very own ident server :-)

To have a "normal" identd:

    # ident-usermap tcpserver 0 auth setuidgid nobody ident-portmap ident-read ident-unmap ident-write

To reply with a numeric userid instead of textual username, omit `ident-usermap`.

To always reply with the same fixed username:

    # IDENT_USER=partycat tcpserver 0 auth setuidgid nobody ident-read ident-write

To reply with a random identstring every time:

    # tcpserver 0 auth setuidgid nobody ident-read \
        sh -c 'IDENT_USER=$(head -c 16 /dev/random | base64) ident-write'

You can also customize the operating system in the reply (default `UNIX`):

    # IDENT_OPSYS=$(uname)
